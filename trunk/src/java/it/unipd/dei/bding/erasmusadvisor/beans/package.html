Contains the beans used by the application.

Along with the package resources, it is the MODEL of the MVC architecture. 
The Entity Beans contained in this package have a one-to-one correspondence 
with the database schema: for each table in the database, it corresponds to a bean class, 
whose attributes are instance variables private, accessible only by the getter / setter methods. 
The data types are mapped appropriately to maintain compatibility between the relational model and the object.
