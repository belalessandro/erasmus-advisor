Manages the Web application (controller).

It is the CONTROLLER of the MVC architecture. 
Each class is a Servlet and handles a specific macro-concept. 
For each of them is associated with one or more JSP pages (VIEW) 
to display the requested data. The organization of the methods 
follows the most natural way: GET to receive one or more data to the Servlet, 
POST to send data or submit operations. 
In response to the actions requested by the user, 
the typical Servlet is responsible for receiving any parameters, 
creating and properly closing a (single) connection to the database 
(which is used by the static methods of the package database), 
perform the required operations, working in transactional mode 
(commit, in case of success, or rollback) and handle any errors. 
The results are then sent to the appropriate JSP pages, 
or they can be returned in JSON format, 
if the request is asynchronous. 
Furthermore, such an organization allows the use of Ajax techniques, 
and the interfacing with applications for mobile devices.
