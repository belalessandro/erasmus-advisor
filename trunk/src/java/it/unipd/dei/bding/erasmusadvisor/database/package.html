Contains the methods to execute SQL instructions in the database.

Static methods in each class receives an instance of Connection and execute the specific SQL query. 
The connection is never closed, it is the responsibility of the caller 
(eg Servlet) to properly close the connection and handle any transactions. 
The Statement, ResultSet and PrepearedStatement, in contrast, 
are always closed in the method directly after use. 
In passing parameters to methods, instead of the individual fields, 
you can use the appropriate Bean, populating them beforehand with the necessary fields. 
In this way, there is a greater flexibility and homogeneity. 
This package sometimes uses the library Apache Commons BeanUtils and DbUtils, 
which provide methods to accomplish many repetitive tasks of JDBC 
(such as the closure of the correct Connection, populating Bean, querying and parsing the results). 
The library is not an ORM, but it is very lightweight and maintains 
correspondence with manual instructions: whenever possible, 
it will be used in order to simplify the code. 
The operations carried out by the methods are of type: 
Create, Update, Delete, Read (synonyms Get / Search / Filter / Find)
